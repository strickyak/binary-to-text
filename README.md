# Github Repo strickyak/binary-to-text

`bin2hhc` converts a binary file into a text file
for the purpose of diffing binary files with fairly
small differences.

The textfile format has one line of text for each byte
in the binary file:

*   If the byte was in the range 32 to 126, the non-control
ASCII characters, the line will have four characters:
two hex chars, a space, and the character which is the
byte from the binary file.

*   Otherwise, the line will have two characters:
two hex chars representing the value of the byte
from the binary file.

Usage:

```
$ make

$ ./bin2hhc < b1 > t1
$ ./bin2hhc < b2 > t2

$ diff t1 t2
or
$ vimdiff t1 t2
```

If you want to edit one of the text files and then convert
it back to binary with `hhc2bin`, here is how the lines
are interpreted:

*  Empty lines are skipped

*  If a line has only one character, that one character
is written verbatim to the binary file.

*  If a line has 2 or more characters, the first two
must be hex characters, and those 2 hex characters define
the byte to be written.

*  If a line has 99 or more characters, it will confuse
the program and cause incorrect results.  Don't make long lines.

Notice that if a text line was generated by `bin2hhc`
and it has four characters, and you edit that line to
a different four characters, it is the hex value and not
the final char that is used by `hhc2bin`.

Usage (continuing from above):

```
$ vi t1    # make changes to it

$ ./hhc2bin < t1 > b1new
```
